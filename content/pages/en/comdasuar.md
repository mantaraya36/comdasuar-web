# About 

This website is devoted to the study of the Digital-Analog Computer Asuar:
COMDASUAR, a personal computer built by composer and engineer Jose Vicente Asuar
in Chile around 1978.  COMDASUAR is not only part of the first generation of
micro computers to be able to produce and process sound but also it can be
considered one in a kind personal computer.

 
In Santiago de Chile in 1980 José Vicente Asuar published in the Chilean Music
Journal a paper entitled “A System to Make Music with a Micro Computer”. In
that paper he describes in precise academic language the construction,
implementation, development and results of  “Computer Digital Analog Asuar
COMDASUAR”, a microcomputer built by him in 1978 with the main purpose of
composing music. Of course this task included writing the software in machine
language and putting together all the necessary hardware. Asuar built the
microcomputer after the acquisition of  "the first truly usable
microprocessor", the Intel 8080. In fact the construction of this computer is
the result of almost ten years of previous experience working with other
computers, like the PDP-8, to compose music (44). The Intel 8080 was the
microprocessor used in the influential Altair 8080, the machine that started
the fever for the personal computers in the United States.
