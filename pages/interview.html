<h1>Interview with José Vicente Asuar</h1>
<h2>Transcription</h2>
<p><strong>José Vicente Asuar</strong>: […] We are talking about a time when the Personal Computer did not exist; so the idea to make this kind of instruments was farfetched. I am talking about 1972, 1973 and 1974.</p>
<p>However in 1976 I was working as a professor in the Electrics Department at the Faculty of Engineering at the Universidad de Chile and they we were more or less up to date with what was being produced in the field of technology. It was there where I learned that a group of engineers who started a new company now known as Intel, had developed something that IBM did not want to develop, that is a chip with a microprocessor that was equivalent to what we now know as a CPU, that is to say the Processor Control Unit, to be able to produce smaller computers.</p>
<p>This interested me because some prototypes started arriving to Chile. There were two options, there was the Intel one and the one produced by Motorola. I studied both, but I decided on the Intel mostly because of the peripherals, because they adjusted better to the project I had in mind. Intel had more peripherals than the Motorola option. Thus, with the processor came the conception of the equipment (COMDASUAR). It was going to be digital and analogue at the same time.</p>
<p>The digital part would correspond to the “creative” face, if you like, this was going to be part of the “Proyecto Formas” and the analogue part corresponded to the manipulation of sound, given that at that time digital sound was not fully developed I was forced to use an analogue support.  That was how the equipment took shape. The other idea I had was that the instrument must be portable. </p>
<p>I had had the experience of the LP “El Computador Virtuoso” that was widely sold, as a matter of fact it was out of stock in both its versions, and I am under the impression that it was all sold amongst music teachers in the country because it came to satisfy many expectations. It had on one side of the record a talk about sound, characteristics of sound with examples, which means that it was very useful for music classes. I wanted to make a portable instrument to be able to go to educational institutions, where youth would be, go to the music schools and to make demonstrations in different auditoriums.
It was then when I started developing other lines, because of the idea of going everywhere with a portable computer was very ambitious. I needed a television screen to able to communicate with this computer, I had to have a keyboard like a typewriter one and so on, to make a portable computer with all of these things was a difficult task.</p>
<p>To me “portable” meant that it only required to be connected to electricity; that it could be transported in the backseat of the car, and that only two people were required to operate it. That was the general idea I had when I was making this instrument and here I am only talking about hardware. In the digital field the computer had to bring a series of programs that involved creative and game aspects and in the analogue part it had to bring sounds. I don’t know if I should continue with this subject or am I extending too much Andrés?</p>
<p><strong>Andrés Burbano</strong>: No, we were just beginning.</p>
<p><strong>J.V.A</strong>: We were talking about the relationship between the state of the art, technology... limitations… in other words of how different it was then from today and what was the purpose of fabricating this instrument, In addition of making a new instrument that had these parts: to produce musical ideas (or help creatively) it was also important to me to be able to process the sound in real time and that it would be portable. I repeat this idea as much because unfortunately I did not achieve it. Initially I made a design in which I was thinking to include the screen in the structure, inside the box of the instrument, but it took too much space and I also had the problem that the high frequency of the screen could interfere, inducing undesired noises and signals into the audio. Thus I decided to leave the screen outside of the instrument, nevertheless I could incorporate the keyboard to the instrument, the screen was still outside so it needed two power sources.</p>
<p><strong>A.B.</strong> The screen was a television set right?</p>
<p><strong>J.V.A.</strong>: Yes, it was a common television set, one of those that the I.R.T. (Radio and Television Industry) use to ensemble here in Chile. It was standard in black and white and very small but it was possible to see the numbers, the instructions and all the characters.</p>
<p>The other problem I faced was that the hardware consisted, in the digital part, of a board that was sold in a kit by Intel. The circuit was printed on that board and then there were all the components that were sold separately and everything had to be welded together. In my case I had to add other components and so the board was overloaded. In the analogue part I made the printed circuits myself and designed the different elements, the systems, the circuits for every module.</p>
